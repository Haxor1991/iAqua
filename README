Only stored here for archive purposes, this the last version of my iAqua code, along with all of the image files for my arduino based aquarium controller for a freshwater planted tank. 

This project was abandoned by me when I moved on from the hobby, but it lives on in the thread below:

Pictures of the final controller fully assembled in its case:

Key featuers:

• Colorful iPhone inspired touch screen interface
• Nearly all settings are accessed and changed in the GUI, not in code
• All settings saved/retrieved with EEPROM (persistent memory after reboot)
• All graphics stored on external SD card
• Scheduling is available in the GUI for power relays, lighting fades, and dosing pumps
• Automated control of 8 power relays (120v, optically isolated for safety)
—• Light1, Light2, Filter, Circulation Pump, Heater, CO2, Aux1, and Aux2
—• All power relays can be toggled on/off in the GUI at any time
—• 6 of the power relays can be scheduled for daily on and off times (not filter or heat)
—• One touch Feeding routine that controls power
——• Sets all power relays to a configured state for a configured amount of time
——• example: turn off filter, circulation pump, heater, and CO2 for 10 minutes
——• Returns all power relays to previous state when time has expired
——• *If CO2 schedule turned off CO2 during feeding, it will not turn back on
• Automated control of Heater for safety
—• Configurable high temp to turn off heater power relay
—• Temp on home screen turns red, and stays red until you touch it to acknowledge you've seen it
—• Configurable low temp to turn heat back on
—• Configurable low temp to sound a tone alarm (i.e. heater broke)
• Automated control of Current Satellite Plus via IR, or any LED lights controllable via PWM (up to 4 channels, RGBW)
—• Adjust and save 4 lighting modes (High Sun, Mid Sun, Low Sun, Moon)
—• Automated fading between light modes
—• Schedule start time and duration of each of the following ramps
——• Moon to Low Sun
——• Low Sun to Mid Sun
——• Mid Sun to High Sun
——• Mid Sun to Low Sun
——• Low Sun to Moon
• Automated control of 2 dosing pumps for Macro and Micro liquid fertilizer
—• Schedule individual days and time for each pump to run
—• Calibrate/Test pump speed in GUI for each pump
—• Configurable amount of mL to pump per dose (applies to both pumps)
—• Configurable volume of fertilizer reservoir 
—• Fill button to reset volume when you fill so it can tell you how much is left
• Set date/time directly in GUI• 
• Auto-dimming display
—• Display dims to match ambient lighting
—• Display goes to full bright when touched, returns to dim after a user settable amount of time
—• Dimming can be disabled and brightness can be manually adjusted in the GUI
• Home screen displays in real time (updated every 5 sec):
—• Date/Time
—• Aquarium water temperature
—• Number of hours since fish were fed
—• Current lighting mode
—• If lighting is actively fading, it shows what mode is transitioning to what, and how much time is left
—• Remaining fertilizer in Macro/Micro reservoirs
—• On/Off status of all 8 power outlets
